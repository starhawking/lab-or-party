## Hacking PXE Boot into the lab nova codebase

I suspect that I could forcibly inject pxe booting into the libvirt.xml generated by nova by appending another element before the following line:

It looks like the segment from blockinfo.py should give an idea of the sort of formatting that is expected. It doesn't look like its expecting an object to be passed or anything. It looks like its just expecting a list.

```python
        if self.boot_order:
            dev.append(etree.Element("boot", order=self.boot_order))
```
